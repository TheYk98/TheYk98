### âš¡ I'm Yukesh Kumar (a.k.a YK ) and I'm an engineer who solves problems with a bit of code. Well, Obviously I'm talented , it doesn't mean I know everything :D . My expertise is at Engineering & Reverse engineering . I'm so so good at it. 
 
# ðŸ’¼ I Chose to work for:
## Bytedance - Software Engineer II(Financial Engineering)
- I build product to serve payments on tiktok shop and tiktok live. (Newbie yet)
## Grab  -  Software Engineer,Backend (Financial Engineering)
> The reason I chose is an intersting one :D . I Googled for tech companies to watch out for , and somehow managed to land on a post where an ex-googler shared his experience @ Grab . I was like oh okay! sounds cool. I liked the motivation and problem they're solving and managed to get a job as an intern . 
- Me & my team built a super awesome reconciliation product that helps Grab analyze  transactions that are using Grab Platform. We Help our Finance team by generating a monthly report which helps them track down details at the atom level .
- I build scalable software like memory efficient file readers, which helps Grab read millions and millions of data in a matter of seconds and lower RAM. 
- Our system handles a volume of 100Mn transactions/month (50Mn x 2) . And , We build dashboards(like powerbi) for anyday report.
- Tech Stack : Go , Mysql , AWS , Grafana
